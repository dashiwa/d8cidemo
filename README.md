# Obsolete

This Drupal 8 project started with a CircleCI integration but then after adding
a Travis CI integration it started to become confusing maintaining the two of them
so new demos are being created.

For Drupal 8 and CircleCI, check out https://github.com/juampynr/drupal8-circleci.

For Drupal 8 and Travis CI, you will be interested in looking at the `.travis.yml`
file and the `.travis` directory of this repository. We will move this to a
new repository as we did for CircleCI.
